        <h1>Sample project demonstrating real-world usage of <a
                href="http://github.com/cemerick/austin">Austin</a>'s browser-connected REPL
            support</h1>
        <p>If you're reading this on github, feel free to follow along, but
            it'll be a lot more fun if you clone <a
                href="http://github.com/cemerick/austin">the repo</a> and get
            your hands dirty!</p>

        <p>Austin is a really just a significant refactoring of ClojureScript's
            standard browser-REPL, so <a
                href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/The-REPL-and-Evaluation-Environments">all
                of its tutorials</a> generally apply to Austin as well.
            However, Austin provides a workflow that I personally find much
            easier to
            use, especially if I want to have multiple browser-connected REPLs
            in flight at the same time.</p>

        <h2>Running the sample app</h2>

        Assuming you've cloned <a
            href="https://github.com/cemerick/austin">Austin's repo</a> to
        <code>$AUSTIN</code> (wherever that is), do this:

        <ol>
            <li><code>cd</code> to
                <code>$AUSTIN/browser-connected-repl-sample</code>, and run:
                <pre>$ lein do cljsbuild once, repl</pre> This will compile the
                dummy sample ClojureScript namespace in
                <code>$AUSTIN/src/cljs</code>, which happens to require the
                ClojureScript browser-REPL client-side namespace.</li>
            <li>Once you're in the REPL (it will start up in the
                sample app's main namespace,
                <code>cemerick.austin.bcrepl-sample</code>), evaluate
                <code>(run)</code>.  That just starts jetty on port
                <code>8080</code>; if you open a browser to <a
                    href="http://localhost:8080">that server</a>, you'll
                see this page (which the sample re-uses as its only
                content).</li>
            <li>Create a new Austin ClojureScript REPL environment,
                like so:
                <pre>(def repl-env (reset! cemerick.austin.repls/browser-repl-env
                      (cemerick.austin/repl-env)))</pre>
                This also <code>reset!</code>'s the new REPL environment into the
                <code>browser-repl-env</code> atom.  The sample app uses
                code like this:

                <pre>[:script (cemerick.austin.repls/browser-connected-repl-js)]</pre>

                to drop a snippet of JavaScript into the page that will cause
                the browser-REPL to connect to whichever REPL environment is in
                <code>browser-repl-env</code>; your app should do likewise.</li>
            <li>Turn your Clojure REPL into a ClojureScript REPL
                tied to that REPL environment with
                <pre>(cemerick.austin.repls/cljs-repl repl-env)</pre></li>
            <li>Now that the ClojureScript REPL is ready, you need to load <a
                    href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>, or
                reload it if you brought it up before the REPL environment was
                created and <code>reset!</code> into the
                <code>browser-repl-env</code> atom.  Once you do that, evaluate
                some ClojureScript to
                make sure your shiny new REPL
                is working, e.g. <pre>(js/alert "Salut!")</pre></li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            You can reload your app's page as many times as you like; it will
            re-connect on each page load to the same REPL environment.  If you want
            to connect to a <em>different</em> REPL environment, just put the
            it into <code>browser-repl-env</code> prior to loading the page you'd
            like to have connected to it.  At some point, Austin may provide a
            bit of ClojureScript that will allow you to choose (from within the
            browser) which REPL environment to which you'd like to connect…
